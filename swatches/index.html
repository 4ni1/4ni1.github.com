  <p>Designers often find inspiration from other designers, and the use of color by designers across the web is of particular interest to me. Later, I forget where this color inspiration came from or the exact hex color values that were used in the design. To aid my ailing color memory and general knowledge of color on the web, Swatches is a log containing color swatches of hex color values I don't want to forget. If taken from elsewhere on the web, I've done my best to attribute the source and I encourage you to borrow and copy as you'd like.</p>
