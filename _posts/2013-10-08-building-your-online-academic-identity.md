title: Building Your Online Academic Identity
---
Today I gave a workshop at the [University of Michigan's Institute for the Humanities](http://www.lsa.umich.edu/humanities/) aimed at faculty and graduate students looking to build-up their online identity. There's already been great work done by the writers at [ProfHacker on this topic](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/creating-and-maintaining-a-professional-presence-online-a-roundup-and-reflection/43030), great thinking about it over at [EDUCAUSE](http://www.educause.edu/ero/article/intentional-web-presence-10-seo-strategies-every-academic-needs-know), and an article published in [First Monday](http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/3969/3292) studying and classifying the types of online academic personas folks are starting to create for themselves. This workshop tried to bring all of that together and emphasize that building your online persona is in many ways just SEO for your name. 

In the spirit of sharing, I've made my notes available -- you can check them out at <goo.gl/Hn3Cc9>.
