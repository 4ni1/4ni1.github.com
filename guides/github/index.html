  <h1>Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub</h1>
  <p>This is stub for a talk that I'll be giving on creating a personal website using Jekyll and hosting it for free using GitHub Pages.</p>
	</div>

  <p>Before we get started â€“ you should know about (and probably bookmark) these great tutorials that introduce the tools that I'm going to go over: <a href="http://24ways.org/2013/get-started-with-github-pages/" title="Get Started with GitHub Pages by Anna Debenham">Anna Debenham</a>, <a href="http://www.thinkful.com/learn/a-guide-to-using-github-pages/" title="A Guide To Using GitHub Pages by Thinkful">Thinkful</a>, and even <a href="https://pages.github.com/" title="GitHub Pages">GitHub</a> itself go above and beyond making GitHub hosting and Jekyll templates accessible to a wider audience. And I want that to continue to an academic audience for both personal and publishing uses.</p>

  <p>I came to use GitHub Pages after 10+ years of WordPress use. I still use WordPress for certain projects. But when you want something simple, having a WordPress site often comes with a lot of other things: a web hosting plan, updating plugins, monitoring auto-updates so your sites template and functionality don't break, a MySQL database, dealing with being a target for hackers, Thesis, and on and on. <!-- flesh the previous sentence out with links --> For a personal website that features just few pages, a CV, and maybe a place to write up blog posts, or just experiment around with the awesomeness of html5 <!-- flesh this out with links to codepen stuff or --> and the amazing things you can do with server side scripting <!-- ahem, more links -->, WordPress starts to look like a bloated, bottom heavy machine for me. Do I really need to make a database call to serve an About page with 300 words on it? No. Do I want a bunch of third-party scripts from whatever plugin(s) I'm using just to have social sharing tools? No. Do I want to have to hack an existing WordPress template to bend it into a simplified user experience? No. I still want to be able to get up and running in less than five minutes, but can't it be a little lighter?</p>

<p>There are a lot of lightweight CMS options out there <!-- links --> but I fell for GitHub. It's well known and established, and the partnership it has developed with Jekyll developers (its based in Ruby), embracing of markdown to separate content from markup, just seemed to click with me as a digital publisher.</p>
