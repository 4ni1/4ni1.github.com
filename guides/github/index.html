  <h1>Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub</h1>
  <p>A Step-by-Step Guide to creating a personal website using Jekyll and hosting it for free using GitHub Pages.</p>
	</div>

  <p>Before we get started – you should know about (and probably bookmark) these great tutorials that introduce the tools that I'm going to go over: <a href="http://24ways.org/2013/get-started-with-github-pages/" title="Get Started with GitHub Pages by Anna Debenham">Anna Debenham</a>, <a href="http://www.thinkful.com/learn/a-guide-to-using-github-pages/" title="A Guide To Using GitHub Pages by Thinkful">Thinkful</a>, and even <a href="https://pages.github.com/" title="GitHub Pages">GitHub</a> itself go above and beyond making GitHub hosting and Jekyll templates accessible to a wider audience. And I want that to continue to an academic audience for both personal and publishing uses.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
  <p>I came to GitHub Pages after 10+ years of WordPress use. I still use WordPress for certain projects. But when you want something simple, having a WordPress site often comes with a lot of other things: a web hosting plan, updating plugins, monitoring auto-updates so your sites template and functionality don't break, a MySQL database, dealing with being a target for hackers, Thesis, and on and on. <!-- flesh the previous sentence out with links --> For a personal website that features just few pages, a CV, and maybe a place to write blog posts and link to your social media accounts and departmental web pages – or just experiment around with the awesomeness of HTML5 <!-- flesh this out with links to codepen stuff or --> and the amazing things you can do with server side scripting <!-- ahem, more links -->, WordPress starts to look pretty bloated. Do I really need to make a database call to serve an About page with 500 words on it? No. Do I want a bunch of third-party scripts from whatever plugin(s) I'm using just to have social sharing tools? No. Do I want to have to hack PHP in an existing WordPress template to adjust the banner for my logo? To simplify the user experience? No. I still want to be able to get up and running in less than five minutes, but can't it be a little lighter?</p>

<p>There are a lot of lightweight CMS options out there <!-- links --> but I fell for GitHub. It's well known and established, and the partnership it has developed with Jekyll developers (it's based in Ruby) and its use of markdown to separate content from markup just seemed to click with me as a digital publisher.</p>

<p>I made a list of the things I wanted for my personal website:
	<ul>
		<li>I wanted simplicity.
				<li>I wanted to have an authoritative site for my online brand.</li>
				<li>I wanted a fast loading website.</li>
				<li>I wanted the hosting to be free or really cheap.</li>
				<li>I wanted to use a custom domain.</li>
				<li>I wanted to be able to work on my site from anywhere if needed.</li>
				<li>I want to use a supported framework that others are using.</li>
				<li>I want to get up and running quickly.</li>
				<li>I needed to be able to have version control on my website, preferably Git.</li>
				<li>I wanted a landing page, CV and link out to my publications and presentations, contact info page, and a place to store projects, experiments, longer form ideas, and publicize things.</li>
		</ul>
</p>

<p>So I built my new website using GitHub Pages to host it, and Jekyll to create templates and have a blog-like functionality for my website. But all it really is is static HTML pages sprinkled with a little bit of JavaScript.</p>

<h2>Okay. So, What is GitHub?</h2>
<p>GitHub is a freely available repository for source code, a place where people place code they write so others can use it, improve it, remix it, all based on the popular version control method known as Git. The container for the code of a specific project is called a repository. Git can be really complicated and powerful if you need it to be.</p>

<p>Usually, people just host files, and what you on the end view is the code</p>

<!-- insert image of a project on github -->

<p>GitHub Pages lets you do this, but if the pages are HTML or Markdown, you can view the file like any other website.</p>
